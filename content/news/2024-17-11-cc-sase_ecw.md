I'm chairing the 2025 [SASE Early Career Workshop](https://sase.org/event/2025-montreal/#2025-sase-early-career-workshop) committee. The SASE Early Career Workshop (ECW) is a one-day workshop that provides an opportunity for a longer and deeper discussion of applicants' conference papers. It takes place the day before the start of the annual conference (8 July 2025). The 2025 Early Career Workshop will be hosted in partnership with McGill University, with senior SASE and McGill professors. The (hard) deadline for submissions: 16 December 2024.

A detailed call can be found [here](/2025_cfa_sase_ecw.pdf).
