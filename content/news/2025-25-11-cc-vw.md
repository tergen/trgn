Together with Helen Callaghan and Bob Hancké I'm organizing a Volkswagen Foundation-sponsored symposium on *Europe’s industrial policy options in the digital, green and geoeconomic transitions.* The symposium offers an exceptional platform for early career researchers to join leading experts in a critical dialogue on the future of Europe in a rapidly changing global landscape. The (hard) deadline for submissions: February 10, 2026.

A detailed call can be found [here](/2026_cfa_volkswagen.pdf).
