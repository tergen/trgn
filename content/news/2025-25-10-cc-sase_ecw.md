I'm chairing the 2026 [SASE Early Career Workshop](https://sase.org/events/2026-bordeaux/#early-career-workshop). The SASE Early Career Workshop (ECW) is a one-day workshop that provides an opportunity for a longer and deeper discussion of applicants' conference papers. It takes place the day before the start of the annual conference (30 June 2026). The 2026 Early Career Workshop will be hosted at Sciences Po Bordeaux, with senior SASE professors. The (hard) deadline for submissions: 12 December 2025.

A detailed call can be found [here](/2026_cfa_sase_ecw.pdf).
