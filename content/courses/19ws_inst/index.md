## Course Information

**Instructor:** Dr. Timur Ergen (te@mpifg.de)  
**Institution:** Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies (MPIfG)  
**Semester:** Fall 2019  
**Schedule:** Fridays at 2 pm in S-242  
**Institution:** University of Cologne

Theories of institutions have been at the core of the social and behavioral sciences throughout the 20th and early 21st century. The course introduces theories of institutions from across the social sciences. The material covered ranges from institutional theory's classical origins through to recent debates about the explanation of institutional change.

The course is paradigmatically eclectic, covering positions from classical anthropology, institutional economics, historical political science, and organizational sociology. Among the main problems discussed are the relationship between social action and institutions, the origins of social order and change, the role of culture and norms in social organization, and the interplay between social power and institutions.
