## Course Information

**Instructors:** Dr. Timur Ergen (te@mpifg.de) & Dr. Sebastian Kohl (sk@mpifg.de)  
**Institution:** Universität Duisburg-Essen  
**Semester:** Winter 2018  
**Format:** Block Seminar

This seminar discusses the historical development, organizational structures, and societal impacts of multinational corporations. Estimates suggest that currently up to 80 percent of world trade takes place in value chains connected with multinational enterprises. Multinational corporations have no less direct or indirect influence on transnational trade and economic policy, environmental protection, and working conditions in global capitalism.

The seminar provides an introduction to analyses and theories of multinational corporations that lay the groundwork for systematic and critical examination of their influence. Given their importance, multinational corporations stand surprisingly rarely at the center of social science investigations. The seminar addresses students with interests in economic topics in sociology, but also students with historical interests or interest in contemporary questions about aspects of globalization.
