## Course Information

**Instructor:** Dr. Timur Ergen  
**Institution:** Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies
**Semester:** Spring 2018  
**Schedule:** Tuesdays, 2:00–3:30  
**Location:** Paulstraße 3

The seminar focuses on recent debates on the interrelations between economy and society. It builds on a second course taught in Fall on foundational controversies (Economy & Society I). The goal is to familiarize students with several major theories, approaches and topics that contribute to our understanding of the interrelations between the economy and society.

The seminar proceeds from the assumption that economic action and economic structures are socially, politically and culturally constituted. Understanding the processes leading to the actual forms of organization of the economy and to the specific forms of agency within the economy is the primary goal of economic sociology.
