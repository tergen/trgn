Technological innovations are core drivers of economic and social dynamics in modern societies. The seminar introduces social science perspectives on the origins, forms, and effects of innovations. Key questions include where inventions and innovations come from, how regional divides in innovative activity emerge, how states influence and direct innovation, and how technological change affects societies.

The seminar covers literatures from various theoretical and methodological perspectives, including history and historical sociology, economics, quantitative political science, comparative political sociology, and social network analysis. Besides delving into empirical material, we work through exemplary debates on the forms and functions of innovation since World War II, especially concerning industrial policy and international competitiveness.
