This seminar explores central topics of political economy and economic sociology, ranging from the origins of the two disciplines—when they were not yet separated—to theories on the relationship between capitalism and democracy. Seminar readings reflect the major political-economic controversies of modernity: the origin and peculiarities of the capitalist economic system; the role of politics in a liberal economic order; the need for reform and the possibility of revolution; the limits of state regulation and social control of the capitalist economy; and the relationship between the capitalist market economy and modern culture.

## Assessment

Discussion of the readings will make up the core of the seminar sessions. Students are expected to read all assigned texts and to participate regularly and actively. To get credit (6 CP), students must (1) do all assigned readings; (2) prepare three reading reports (1,500 words); (3) and submit final papers (10,000 characters).

The reading reports are intended to prepare the ground for discussions by asking participants to set out their responses to the readings in written form. Memos should not just summarize the readings, but rather take up specific arguments, compare the positions of different authors, raise questions of evidence, usefulness, or plausibility or draw attention to particular strengths and weaknesses in the arguments and descriptions. We will share these memos through email. In order for everyone to have time to read over the comments of others, these will be due by 4 pm on the day before the class meets.
