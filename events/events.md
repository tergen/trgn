## [The role of the state in digital transitions](/events/events_files/2021_sase_digital.pdf)

Together with [Andrea M. Herrmann](http://www.andrea-herrmann.eu) and [Philipp Staab](https://www.sowi.hu-berlin.de/de/lehrbereiche/zukunftarbeit/mitarbeiter_innen/pstaab) we are planning to organize a series of panels and workshops on the role of the state in digital transitions in 2021 and 2022. Our aim is to build an interdisciplinary community to systematically discuss how states shape digital industries and processes of digitalization. A more detailed expos√© of the workshops' underlying ideas can be found [here](/events/events_files/2021_sase_digital.pdf).

To explore the field, we invite paper abstracts on the role of the state in the digital economy from which we will assemble thematic panels during the [2021 SASE Annual Meeting](https://sase.org/event/2021-sase-conference/). We are currently in the early planning stages for a first follow-up workshop at the MPIfG Cologne and a Special Issue on the topic.

If you are interested in participating, please [submit](https://sase.org/events/conference-submission-and-award-guidelines/) an abstract to SASE's Network J "Digital Economy" by January 30 (SASE's January 16 deadline plus a planned 14-day extension) and send a brief email to [Timur Ergen](mailto:te@mpifg.de).
