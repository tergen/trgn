I'm a sociologist at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies](https://www.mpifg.de). Most of my empirical research has been on energy transitions, economic competition, innovation policy, and the history of the postindustrial economy. I also work on theoretical problems, such as  the place of innovation in pragmatist sociology, the question of how to reconcile theories from political economy and economic sociology, and the role of collective expectations in politics. I'm a co-organizer of the [SASE](https://sase.org) Research Network *Digital Economy*.
