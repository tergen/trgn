Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](/about/about_files/vita.pdf)

I am a senior researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies](https://www.mpifg.de) and an interim professor of sociological theory at the [University of Oldenburg](https://uol.de/ast). I co-organize the [SASE](https://sase.org) Research Network *Digital Economy* and have been a member of [SASE's Executive Council](https://sase.org/about/leadership/) since 2020.

My empirical research investigates climate policies, energy transitions, economic competition, multinational firms, innovation and technology policies, and the postindustrial economy. Currently, I am working on papers on institutional change in climate change policies in the European Union and on conditionality in industrial policy. I am also finishing work on my second book based on a comparative historical sociology of deindustrialization in Germany and the United States.
