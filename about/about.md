Here is my [Curriculum Vitae](/about/about_files/vita.pdf)

I'm a John F. Kennedy Memorial Fellow at the [Center for European Studies at Harvard University](https://ces.fas.harvard.edu) and a senior researcher at the [Max Planck Institute for the Study of Societies](https://www.mpifg.de). For the 2022â€“2023 academic year, I'm an affiliate of the [Weatherhead Research Cluster on Comparative Inequality and Inclusion at Harvard University](https://inequality.wcfia.harvard.edu/people/timur-ergen).

Most of my empirical research is on energy transitions, economic competition, multinational enterprise, innovation and technology policy, and the postindustrial economy. I also work on theoretical problems, such as the contribution of pragmatist thought to understand socioeconomic change, the question of how to reconcile theories from political economy and economic sociology, and the role of collective expectations in social change. I'm a co-organizer of the [SASE](https://sase.org) Research Network *Digital Economy* and a member of [SASE's Executive Council](https://sase.org/about/leadership/).
